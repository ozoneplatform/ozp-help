<h1>Create a Listing</h1>

<p>Anyone can create a listing. Only stewards can approve them. This section explains how to create a listing and it defines each field on the Create/Edit Listing Form.</p>

<p>To create a listing, from the Global Toolbar click the drop-down Main Menu:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Select <b>Submit a Listing</b></li>
	<li>The Listing Create/Edit Form opens. To save the listing as a draft, you must enter a <b>Name, Type and Owner</b>.<br />
	<i>At this point, you may save the listing without completing it. If you do this, you can open it from your Profile and Listing Management which are accessible from the drop-down Main Menu on the Global Toolbar.</i></li>
	<li>Complete the listing. All fields are required unless marked optional.</li>
	<li>Click <img alt="Save" src="/Doc_images/save.png" title="Save" /> at the top of the form to save. The save icon switches to a green checkmark after saving.</li>
	<li>To preview the listing, click <img alt="show" src="/Doc_images/show-icon.png"   title="show" />.</li>
	<li>When you are ready to publish the listing, click <img alt="Send the listing to a steward for review" src="/Doc_images/send-to-steward.png" title="Send the listing to a steward for review" /> to notify the Organizational Steward that the listing is ready for review. You must complete all required fields before submitting the listing.</li>
	<li>After an organizational steward and Center steward approve the listing, it will appear in Center.</li>
